WORKSHEET TO WORK THROUGH ALGOS

Range Calc for toPoint:
(1: 2x2, 2: 1x4, 3: 2x4, 4:2x8)

2x2 (south and east are the same)
Cords 0,0
0,1 1,1 1,0 0,0 valid

1X4
Cords 0,0
East: 0,0-3
South: 0-3, 0

2X4
Cords 0,0
East: 0-1,0-3
South: 0-3, 0-1

2X8
Cords 0,0
East: 0-1,0-7
South: 0-7, 0-1


Uplinks/downlinks:

# THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED DRAMATICALLY

Only need to check blocks 1 level lower:
Traverse Blocks on that level in the structure
# @allblocks.each_with_index do |row, row_idx|
#   row.each_with_index do |col, col_idx|
#     if block.toPoint["rangeX"].include?(row_idx) && block.toPoint["rangeY"].include?(col_idx)
#     @allblocks[row_idx][col_idx] = block.getColor
#     end
#   end
# end
Similar to the loops above, check if new block has same range as block being checked
if true:
Add downlink for new block = to that block
Add uplink for block cross checked to new block
